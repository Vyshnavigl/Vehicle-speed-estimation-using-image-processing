# Vehicle-speed-estimation-using-image-processing

The objective of the project is to detect the speed of the vehicles using image processing in python and to save vehicle data.

Life cycle of the project:

Video Acquisition
Region of Interest and Masking
Contour Detection and Object Tracking
Speed Estimation
Save Vehicle Images and speeds
Create Summary
This project can successfully detect multiple vehicles and able to track them and it can evaluate its speed and saves the vehicle data. Vehicle detection is accurate for the static background, estimated speed may vary by 0 - 2 km/h depending on program speed. However, when two vehicles move very closely, they may be detected as one object. Because this project uses movement to distinguish the vehicle from the background, the camera should be as still as possible. It helps in Monitoring speed violators, Providingroad safety and to improve traffic rules and regulations.
